              These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) establish the foundational

              Collectively referred to as the “Platform,” these components

              A key component of these Terms is our Privacy Policy, accessible
              at https://www.onepointservices.co.in/privacy-policy.html. This
              policy outlines our practices for collecting, using, and

              terms, policies, or disclaimers issued by us from time to time
              will be classified as “Supplemental Terms.” It is important to
              note that the Privacy Policy and Supplemental Terms are integral
              to the overall Terms. In the event of a conflict between these
              Terms and the Supplemental Terms related to specific Services, the
              Supplemental Terms will take precedence.

              The Services encompass the operation of a Platform that allows
              users to arrange and schedule various home-based services provided
              by independent third-party service professionals (“
              <span className="c7">Service Professionals</span>”). As part of
              these Services, ONE POINT SERVICES facilitates the deduction of
              commission from the accounts of Service Professionals for the
              services they deliver.

            The services provided by these Service Professionals are
            collectively referred to as “

            that ONE POINT SERVICES does not directly provide these Services and
            is not responsible for their execution. Service Professionals bear
            full responsibility and liability for the services they offer or
            provide through the Platform. Furthermore, ONE POINT SERVICES and
            its affiliates do not employ Service Professionals, nor do Service
            Professionals operate as agents, contractors, or partners of ONE
            POINT SERVICES or its affiliates. Service Professionals lack the
            authority to bind or represent ONE POINT SERVICES in any capacity.

              Additionally, the Platform is designed for use exclusively within
              India. When users seek to access the Services or Pro Services
              outside of the Indian jurisdiction, acceptance of the applicable
              terms and conditions of ONE POINT SERVICES for that jurisdiction
              will be assumed.
